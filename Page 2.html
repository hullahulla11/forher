  <h1>I knew you will press Yes. Now sit back, relax, read and smile pretty woman ðŸ’œ</h1>
  <h2>The following what you are going to read is about the reason why you should go out on dates with me. Read it with an open mind cutie </h2>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="1.png" alt="Scenery 1" class="pic" />
    <div class="text"> The pic you see on the left, is me always waiting for you to text back. I will keep trying my best to make sure this gorgeous woman keeps smiling,blushing, laughing and most importantly feel special about herself. Your texts always make me smile, and when they do not come, it feels like you got kidnapped. Even in my sleep, I always think about you. I know it might sound silly, but that is how much you matter to me.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="3.png" alt="Scenery 2" class="pic" />
    <div class="text">Whenever I go out under the night sky and look at the moon ,I will just sit there, thinking about you. The night calm, but my mind always full of thoughts about you. The moon looks so pretty, but stillâ€¦ not as pretty as you, your eyes , your lips, your ears, your hair and everything about you.  The way you smile, the way your eyes light up when you're happy â€” I think about those moments all the time. You're the kind of beautiful that stays in my mind, even when I close my eyes. I will always want you beside me, sitting  next to me  on that bench and just look at the moon together, even tho your eyes would always be my best view.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="4(music).png" alt="Scenery 3" class="pic" />
    <div class="text"> I would sit under the moon every night and compose the most beautiful song â€” just for you. Every key would tell a story about how much you mean to me. The soft notes would speak of your smile, the higher ones of your laughter, and the deepest notes would carry the quiet moments where I simply miss you. You are my favorite melody, the one I could play forever without getting tired. Even if the world went quiet, I do still hear the sound of you in my heart and your picture in my mind â€” always.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="2.png" alt="Scenery 4" class="pic" />
    <div class="text">If I could ( I will ), Iâ€™d give you every cute plushie in the world â€” just to see you smile. I'd pick the softest, fluffiest onesso youâ€™d always have something to hug when Iâ€™m not around. And not just teddy bearsâ€¦ Iâ€™d give you everything that makes your heart feel warm and happy. Because your smile means everything to me. When youâ€™re happy, the whole world feels brighter. And if a little teddy can bring even a tiny smile to your face, then Iâ€™d carry a hundred of them â€” just for you.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="8.png" alt="Scenery 5" class="pic" />
    <div class="text">Butterflies are beautiful â€” light, colorful, and full of life. But when I think of beauty, I would still think of you first.Every time you talk to me, my stomach fills with butterflies, just like in the movies. It's like a soft flutter inside me, reminding me how much you matter. You donâ€™t even have to try â€” your voice, your laugh, your messages â€” they all make me feel like Iâ€™m floating. Youâ€™re not just someone specialâ€¦ youâ€™re the magic in all my little moments.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="9.png" alt="Scenery 6" class="pic" />
    <div class="text">When I lay down and close my eyes, itâ€™s always you I think about. Your face, your smile, your words â€” they play on repeat in my mind like the windmill blades running 24/7. Whenever you compliment me, I canâ€™t help but smile like a little kidâ€¦ and sometimes, I even blush. You probably donâ€™t realize it, but you have this quiet magic â€” the kind that makes ordinary moments feel special just because youâ€™re in them. Youâ€™re beautiful in your own way, and that's what makes you unforgettable. Just thinking about you, your touch, your kiss, your voice makes everything feel better.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <img src="10(moon).png" alt="Scenery 7" class="pic" />
    <div class="text">I sit here under the moon and honestly? The moon always considers itself to be lucky just to witness you everytime it comes out in the dark night stary sky.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="text">Also if you date me , I will make sure to pamper you with handwritten letters, arm bites, hand holdings, icecreams and forhead kisses for no extra costs.</div>
  <p>So miss gorgeous, will you like to be the pretty woman and I mean the pretty woman who is willing to go on a date with me ? I assure you an upgraded and loving experience </p>
